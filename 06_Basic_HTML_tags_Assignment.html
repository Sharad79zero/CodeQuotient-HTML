    <h2>Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury</h2>
    <p> Summing up Sono's Love Exposure is a task I still do not think I am ready for even after two days of soaking it
      in after my viewing at NYAFF. Some of the many ideas the film dealt with in the 4 hour runtime included commentary
      on religion, cultism, perversion, growing up and coming of age, love, and life. The film tackles many of these
      heavy hitting themes and ideas with a sense of humor found very little in much of the mainstream fluff produced
      today. The balance of subtle often crude humor and darker, heavier, more dramatic aspects of the story really
      works well. Sono creates a product that can appeal to a wider base of people. There is something in this film for
      everyone from the people who enjoy the latest Will Ferrel production to the admirers of Bergman. With a rowdy
      packed house at the NY premiere at the festival the first two and a half hours are a riot and breeze by. There are
      points in the latter portion which start to drag a bit but never could I say I was bored with the film. The movie
      was well made with good cinematography, decent acting, and a great script with fully fleshed out characters. The
      director is able to create an effective commentary on religion, loneliness, Japanese society all the while mixing
      in a lot of body humor, up-skirt shots, and a few lesbian kissing scenes for good measure. Overall highly
      recommended, ignore the 4 hour runtime because it is the fastest 4 hour movie you will see. Ultimately a funny,
      sad, uplifting, and depressing movie all at the same time. </p><img width="300" height="300"

    <h2>The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
    <p> Well, to put it really simple: You must watch this movie.The story basically shows how a girl named Makoto deals
      with her power to leap through time. At first she concentrates on making her life "better", however, she soon
      finds out that every time she leaps back to change something to her advantage others could be affected.It is a
      beautiful story that teaches you to embrace things the way they are, to try to make thing better but to understand
      that what has already happened cant and should not be changed.As I already said, you have to see this movie, even
      if you are not an anime fan. </p><img width="300" height="300"

    <h2>The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak</h2>
    <p> It is so much different from timeloop movies of nowadays where they waste entire hour showing the protagonist
      figuring out what kind of situation he is stuck in(and becoming mad in the process and trying to escape), But it
      did not. Well written witty scifi rom com about the two strangers who come to a Destination wedding at palm
      springs. This is related to time loop and multiverse, with lots of romance and comedy and warm slice of life
      moments. I recommend you this if you are into rom-coms. I Won't be surprised if we got a Solid sequal for this.my
      rating: 8.5/10 </p><img width="300" height="300"
