        It’s good to use em values in this case because em is dynamic — for word spacing,
        it sets the spacing based on the size of the font. In the example above,
        the word spacing is set to 0.3em. The default amount of space between words is usually 0.25em and can be set with the value normal. If you provide a value for word-spacing that’s not normal,
        then the value you provide is added to the default spacing. Therefore,
        since the word-spacing is set to 0.3em,
        your <h1>elements get a total of 0.55em word spacing when rendered.  */

            word-spacing: 10px;

    <p> Ergo proxy is probably one of the best anime of all time, really. I love it's empirical nature, too few anime
        require a functional brain to understand, but this, this made me happy. The plot, the characters, the depth...
        absolutely genius. And this isn't praising it, it's just how it is, plain and simple. If I were to go into
        detail I would need to take a break for a few weeks to write a book about it.
        One of my all time favorites, this piece cannot be described in words. The complex situations and the reasons
        behind them are sometimes almost out of reach of the rational mind, it's exhilarating, you're given a piece of
        the puzzle and you have to fill the rest. I understand why some couldn't get past this idea and gave up trying
        to understand.
        If you watch Ergo Proxy only for the action then you might as well not be watching it at all. This isn't for
        everyone, it isn't even trying to be and I appreciate that. The author of this story simply let his imagination
        free of any constraints and created a masterpiece, one toremember. </p>
