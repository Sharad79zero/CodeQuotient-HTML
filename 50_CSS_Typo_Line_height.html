        /*       We can use the line-height property to
        set how tall we want the line containing
        our text to be, regardless of the height of
        the text. Line heights can take one of several
        values: A unitless number, such as 1.2. This
        number is an absolute value that will compute
        the line height as a ratio of the font size. A 
        number specified by unit, such as 12px. This
        number can be any valid CSS unit,such as pixels,
        percents,ems, or rems. Generally, the unitless 
        ratio value is the preferred method, since it is
        responsive and based exclusively on the current
        font size. In other words, if we change the font size,
        a unitless line-height would automatically readjust,
        whereas the pixel value would remain static.        */

    <span>Much Much Better Than the Original! </span>
    <p>I watched this first then the old one and i mean old one is just a joke. Synder
        created a movie which not only suprass the original one but makes the plot and atmosphere much much better. I
        mean
        old one is just bad... I barely watched it. The character are bad ,the situations are not scary. Zombies are
        slow
        and not dangerous. This is the only movie of synder that I loved and would watch again and again!
        This movie got "Bad Remake" treatment which is not fair. Anyway I loved this I hate the old one. And I love
        George
        Romero's Day of the Dead 1985 9/10. So it doesn't mean I hate the old movies. But original is just bad joke and
        this
        is great movie 8/10 to Dawn of the dead 2004!!!</p>
