        <p id="para1">Here's my list of well made time travel/loop movies from which I am greatly impressed. I have watched almost 60 percent of the stuff but these titles are the best I have ever seen. And yes list is in rankings order. You can go from the last to the top for maximum experience. You should watch time loop movies 2 times at least.

        <p id="para2">It is so much different from timeloop movies of nowadays where they waste entire hour showing the protagonist figuring out what kind of situation he is stuck in(and becoming mad in the process and trying to escape), But it did not. Well written witty scifi rom com about the two strangers who come to a Destination wedding at palm springs. This is related to time loop and multiverse, with lots of romance and comedy and warm slice of life moments. I recommend you this if you are into rom-coms. I Won't be surprised if we got a Solid sequal for this.
