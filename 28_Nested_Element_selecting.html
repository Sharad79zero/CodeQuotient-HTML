        <p>Being Jhon Malkovich is <span>Borderline Arthouse-SciFi-Fantasy</span> movie which brings out really great questions about identity and soul at the same time mocking the main character for doing this. Protagonist is a guy who try to impress a <span>beautiful co-worker</span> but ultimately he turns out to be pretenious horny man. It mocks all those movies which are so called Arthouse and DEEEEP , so arthousy that one can't simply enjoys it. This movie itself belongs to arthouse genre but somehow it is a very very enjoyable movie. Thanks to <span>charlie kaufman</span> for writing such a creative movie in 1999. The concept is great although the mechanics of portal weren't explained properly and captain mertin backstory must be given more screentime.
