    <div> Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007) :It was very hard to place this movie in this feel good list but its worth it! the
        cinematography, the situations , each scene of this movie aged like wine. watched this movie 10+ times and this
        is a must watch feel good movie. Don't know what critics were smoking before reviewing it. It is a must watch
        road trip movie.</div>
