    <p>I felt like crying for no reason..
        A Silent Voice: The Movie (2016)
        The visual storytelling is powerful and effective soundtrack, you don't even need to read the subtitles to know
        what the characters are saying. But I felt sad for that girl. There is a huge shock in this movie. How people
        change. How much a person can be loved. As a teenager I have much more things to learn. Probably If I'll have
        time I will watch it twice. Even I fall in love with ANIME after watched this.</p>
